	<h1>My Dog, Tanner.</h1>
	<p>I have a dog named Tanner and he is 4 years old, this isn't him but he kinda looks like that. I'm not 100% sure what breed my dog is but I think it's a mix between a Jack Russell Terrier and a Cairn Terrier except there's gotta be something else in there because this dog's collar is red and Tanner's is blue.</p>
